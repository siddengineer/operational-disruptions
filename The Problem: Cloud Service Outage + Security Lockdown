Your company runs a SaaS product hosted on AWS. Suddenly, customers worldwide report downtime. At first, it looks like a regional 
AWS issue ‚Äî but it snowballs into multiple, connected problems:

Cloud Region Failure

AWS us-east-1 suffers a partial outage affecting EC2 and S3.

Your application‚Äôs web tier is unavailable in that region.

Failover Misconfiguration

Traffic was supposed to reroute automatically to eu-west-1.

But a misconfigured Route 53 health check marks the wrong endpoints as healthy, leading to blackhole routing.

Security Overreaction

As the ops team tries to fix DNS, the WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules mistakenly block legitimate user traffic, thinking it‚Äôs a DDoS surge.

This locks out paying customers during peak business hours.

CI/CD Deployment Freeze

A pipeline deployment triggered right before the outage is now stuck mid-rollout.

Half the servers are running the old version, half the new version, leading to inconsistent API responses.

üì¢ User Complaints

Customers:

‚ÄúYour app is timing out on login.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome of my data is missing on dashboards.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy can my US team access it but my EU team cannot?‚Äù

Internal Teams:

Customer success teams are dealing with hundreds of angry tickets.

Sales loses demos because the product is unavailable.

Finance panics because subscription billing APIs are failing.

‚ö° Unexpected Obstacles While Fixing

Failover Issues

When engineers try to reroute traffic manually, cached DNS entries worldwide keep pointing to the dead region for hours.

Users in some geographies remain broken despite the fix.

Security Lockdown

Reversing the emergency WAF rules temporarily allows malicious scanning traffic, forcing the security team into a balancing act between uptime and protection.

Stuck Deployment

Rolling back the CI/CD deployment triggers schema mismatches in the database.

Some tables are updated for the new version, others are not, causing data corruption risks.

Cloud Provider Dependency

AWS support confirms the us-east-1 outage might last 6‚Äì8 hours, leaving leadership angry about why the company wasn‚Äôt truly multi-region-ready.
